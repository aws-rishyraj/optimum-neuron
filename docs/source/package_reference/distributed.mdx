# Optimum Neuron Distributed

The `optimum.neuron.distributed` module provides a set of tools to perform distributed training and inference.

## Parallelization

### Base `Parallelizer`

The [`~optimum.neuron.distributed.Parallelizer`] class is the abstract base class being derived for every model supporting model parallelism. It provides methods to parallelize the model and save and load sharded checkpoints.

  - _parallelize
  - parallelize
  - optimizer_for_tp
  - save_model_checkpoint
  - load_model_checkpoint

### Model-specific `Parallelizer`s

Each model that supports parallelization in `optimum-neuron` has its own derived `Parallelizer` class. The factory class [`~optimum.neuron.distributed.ParallelizersManager`] allows you to retrieve such model-specific `Parallelizer`s easily.

  - is_model_supported
  - parallelizer_for_model
